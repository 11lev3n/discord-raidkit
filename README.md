### What is Discord Raidkit?

Discord Raidkit is a compilation of useful tools to help you raid discord servers and hack discord accounts. What sets Discord Raidkit apart from other similar projects is its emphasis on social engineering — Discord Raidkit is *the* raidkit for anyone looking to convince servers to add bots. 

### Why choose Discord Raidkit over similar programs?
There are several reasons to choose Discord raidkit over similar programs:
- Unlike many raiders, Discord Raidkit is free and open-source.
- Unlike many raiders, Discord Raidkit comes with fully functional, non-malicious commands to further aid in social engineering.
- Unlike many raiders, Discord Raidkit is professionally written for performance, running far faster than some other programs.

### What tools are included in Discord Raidkit?

- **Anubis** is a moderation bot that comes with genuine server management commands and some utility commands, like bans and timeouts. Keep note of this when attempting to convince a moderation team to add the bot. Hidden malicious commands can be accessed by the bot owner only (typically you) once added.

- **Qetesh** is a fully functional porn bot with over 10,000 images, channel management, and 25 commands. Qetesh is an easy bot to add to most NSFW servers, as many will blindly add whatever porn bot is requested by their members. Like Anubis, hidden malicious commands can be accessed by the bot owner only once added.

- **Osiris** is a user authentication token handler. With Osiris, you can generate token grabbers that have been adapted to embed themselves within Windows registries, look up information about a token such as the email address and phone number attatched to it, fill up the users server count and mess with their settings, as well as log into an account with just one selenium script. **To use Osiris, you must include [this browser folder](https://drive.proton.me/urls/7898MKJM2W#LIrqn3KDFmsi) - put it in the same directory as `main.py`**
