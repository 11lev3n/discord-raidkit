Discord Raidkit is an open-source, forever free tool that allows you to raid and destroy Discord servers via Discord bots, compromise Discord accounts, and generate Discord token grabbers.

## Why use Discord Raidkit over any other tool? Here's 5 reasons!

- **Developed for social engineering** - both bots have non-malicious slash commands, such as a moderation and NSFW suite (10000+ images!).

- **Asynchronous optimisation** - many tools work synchronously, one request at a time â€” we don't do things like that here.

- **Ease of use** - you can download this toolkit as a single executable, so there's no need to install Python or mess around with npm.

- **Maintained** - the first commit to this repository was made August 3rd, 2020, nearly three years ago. We evolve with discord.py, and Python. 

- **Professionally written** - this tool is written by a real software developer, and it's quite easy to tell!

## Installation

1. Head over to [the latest release](https://github.com/the-cult-of-integral/discord-raidkit/releases/latest).
2. Download the EXE zip.
3. Extract and run the executable in its directory.

## Tools summary

- **Anubis** is a Discord bot with several working moderation features, such as a raid prevention database that can be expanded by a server owner, and moderation slash commands. However, beneath the surface, lay several malicious commands only accessible by the bot owner.

- **Qetesh** is a Discord bot with 25 NSFW commands, supporting over 10000+ NSFW images of the most popular porn-tags according to PornHub, plus some others. Like Anubis, there are also several hidden, malicious commands.

- **Osiris** is a Discord account nuker that also allows you to login to an account and to view its information, such as billing addresses. There is also an inbuilt, improved token grabber that will allow itself to enter a Windows registry if ran.
