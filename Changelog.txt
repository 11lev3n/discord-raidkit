v1.5.4 (05/04/2021):

Additions:
- None.

Changes:
- None.

Reductions:
- After a long thought process, I've decided to remove Seth - it's not worth its own existence; discord intents have already neutered it and if you have admin powers, you can just add a bot in the first place.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions:
- None.

Changes:
- Error screens will now display the base exception that caused them in red.
- Changed various graphical things to be more consistent/true (e.g. Removing instances of "Anubis" from Seth).

Reductions:
- Removed several commands from Seth; self-bots can not have access to intents like discord bots.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions:
- None.

Additions:

- Added commands.CommandNotFound to the on_command_error function.

Changes:
- Updated bot to run correctly under discord.py==1.5 and above (hence the introduction of instances).

- The displays for both nuke and mass_nuke have been slightly altered.

Reductions:
- The hidden .git file has been removed from downloads, resulting in a substantial reduction in storage space needed (40MB to 3.7MB).

Additional Notices:
- The readme.md has been updated to include how to set up the bot instances. You must perform this for any version of Anubis above 1.3.1 to work.
